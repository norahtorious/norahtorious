Thus, for an additive index to be significant, it’s important that the variables that are being combined are on the same scale. Additive index variables are useful when we’re interested in the cumulative amount of something.\nAn average Z-scores refers to an average of a set of z-scores across variables. A z-score is a standardized measurement based on a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

The coefficient of 0.025 suggests that men with higher political efficacy are slightly more likely to have increased future plans compared to females, but the effect is not statistically significant.\nHowever, the model fit is relatively weak, explaining only a small fraction of the variance.
